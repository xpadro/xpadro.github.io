Hi! My name is Xavier Padr√≥ (Xavi) and I am a software engineer based in Barcelona. In the last decade, I've been working in different types of companies like consultancies, corporations and startups.

I'm specialized in backend development. You will mainly read stuff about Java language, sometimes including the Spring framework and sometimes simple raw Java. You can read all those articles here:
